# CANDY
CANDY is a <ins>C<\ins>ontrastive <ins>A<\ins>ligned <ins>N<\ins>eural <ins>DY<\ins>namics (CANDY), an end‑to‑end framework that aligns neural and behavioral data using rank-based contrastive learning, adapted for continuous behavioral variables, to project neural activity from different sessions onto a shared low-dimensional embedding space. CANDY fits a shared linear dynamical system to the aligned embeddings, enabling an interpretable model of the conserved temporal structure in the latent space.
